OpenCMISS-Zinc Library Documentation
====================================


The OpenCMISS-Zinc Library provides the core functionality for developing interactive graphical applications combining models (e.g. FEM) with images, image processing, arbitrary field expressions, plus powerful graphics algorithms and high quality OpenGL rendering. Its implementation supports dynamic editing of the model including creation/destruction of nodes and elements, with graphics automatically updated to show the current state.

This documentation provide overviews and tips on how to use the library, and should be used together with API Reference documentation, and tutorials/examples on the OpenCMISS website.
