OpenCMISS-Zinc Library Documentation
====================================


The OpenCMISS-Zinc Library is made for developing interactive graphical applications combining models (e.g. FEM) with images, image processing, arbitrary field expressions, plus powerful graphics algorithms and high quality OpenGL rendering. It's implementation is designed to support dynamic editing of the model (including creation/destruction of elements), with graphics automatically updated to show the current state.

It is written in C/C++ with native APIs for both languages, and the full API is also available from Python.
