Contributing to OpenCMISS
=========================

One of the key benefits of open source software is that anyone can use and change the code.
This in turn allows many people to improve existing code or contribute new functionality.
We at OpenCMISS want to make contributing as easy as possible while maintaining a high level
of quality.

Prior to contributing code:

   - Subscribe to the OpenCMISS developer mailing list.
   - Watch the appropriate repo that you wish to develop (e.g. iron, zinc, examples, documentation, or website) in your GitHub account.
